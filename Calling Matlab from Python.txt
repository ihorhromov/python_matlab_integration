About software versions
===
I used standard installed version of Anaconda and Matlab 2016
Standard Anaconda allows to use Python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6
Matlab 2016 can be connected with Python 2.7 and Python 3.4
That’s why I chose Python 2.7 for this tutorial, but this version is quite old and I will look for the easiest way to use Python 3.x

===
First steps
===
•	Create new environment in Anaconda with Python 2.7 (easiest way is to do it from Anaconda Navigator)
•	Install jupyter library (easiest way is to do it from Anaconda Navigator)
•	Install matlab engine

===
matlab engine installation
===
To connect Matlab to Python one has to install matlab engine (this requires launching Anaconda as Administrator and then launching Terminal in environment) 
Run next commands:

cd “C:\Program Files (x86)\MATLAB\R2016a\extern\engines\python”
python setup.py install

===
Optional, using Matlab in Jupyter:
===
Installation of matlab-kernel for Jupyter is required to run Matlab in Jupyter(this requires launching Anaconda as Administrator and then launching Terminal in environment)
Run next commands:

pip install matlab_kernel
python -m matlab_kernel install
jupyter kernelspec list
